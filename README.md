# Tempo Based Navigation

This is a WIP personal project that will conenct with Spotify (in the future Apple Music) to allow users to generate playlists of varying tempos to accompany them from Point A to Point B by helping them keep up pace. This web app is intended for walking directions, but more modes of transportation will be added in the future.

At the moment, only the starting and ending destinations can be chosen. More features will be added soon.

## To Do
- [ ] Add tempo customization
- [ ] Add genre customization
- [ ] Add ability to choose starting and ending destinations with mouse
- [ ] Add multiple stopping destinations
- [ ] Add ability to choose mode of transportation
